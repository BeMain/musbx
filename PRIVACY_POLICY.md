# Musician's Toolbox: Privacy Policy
This app, Musician’s Toolbox, offers a set of tools for musicians, including but not limited to a Metronome, a Tuner and a Music player (for changing speed and/or pitch of a song).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences like theme, etc.) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be erased by simply clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The Tuner uses the phone’s microphone to record audio. The data recorded is not stored, neither on device nor on a server, and is only used for the Tuner to function. Audio is only recorded while the app is running.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email at bemain.dev@gmail.com.

Yours sincerly,
Benjamin Agardh
Rydebäck, Sweden
