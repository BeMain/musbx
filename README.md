### Commits
This project follows (since Sep 25 2023) the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for naming commits. Here follows a short summary of that specification.

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

`type` should be one of the following: 

Type    | Description
----    | -----------
feat    | A new feature
fix     | A bug fix
docs    | Docume­ntation only changes
style   | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white­-space, format­ting, missing semi-c­olons, etc)
refactor| A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
perf    | A code change that improves perfor­mance
test    | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
build   | Changes that affect the build system or external depend­encies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
ci      | Changes to our CI config­uration files and scripts
chore   | Other changes that don't modify src or test files
revert  |Reverts a previous commit

A commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE`:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change.

### Branches
A branch should be named as follows:

```
[area]/<description>
```

Example `area`s: `demixer`, `tuner`, `theme`, `music player`
